1. - Display the current time using the appropriate module or function. Use Python's built-in `datetime` module to retrieve the current time and format it for display.
2. - Display the current time in UNIX format using the appropriate module or function. Convert the current time to UNIX timestamp format using the `time` module or other relevant libraries.
3. - Convert a string to a `datetime` datatype and provide proof of the conversion. Implement a function that accepts a user-provided string and converts it to a `datetime` object. Validate the conversion by displaying the converted value.
4. - Check if the current year is a leap year and display the amount of time left until the next leap year. Use the `calendar` module or custom logic to determine if the current year is a leap year. Calculate the time remaining until the next leap year and present it in a human-readable format.
5. - Output a `timedelta` object with options to display only seconds, only days, or only years. Create a function that accepts a `timedelta` object and provides options to extract specific units (seconds, days, or years) from it. Allow users to choose which unit they want to display.
6. - Print a calendar for the current month or a specified month. Use the `calendar` module or external libraries to generate a calendar for the current month or a month specified by the user. Ensure the calendar is displayed in a clear and readable format.
7. - Your team is a multinational one meeting a regional leader based in Tokyo, Japan with the following regions:

  - Dublin / Ireland
  - San Francisco / USA
  - Berlin / Germany
  - Johannesburg / South Africa\
you are asked to  Implement a feature to display the current time in different time zones. Allow users to select a timezone from a list and display the current time in that timezone. Utilize libraries to handle timezone conversions.
8.  Determine and display the current time at the opposite end of the world. Implement a function that calculates the time difference between the user's current location and the opposite end of the world. Display both times to provide a comparison.
9. - Output a random joke from a predefined collection. Create a collection of jokes and implement a function that randomly selects and displays one of the jokes each time it is called.
10. - Implement an additional surprise feature of your choice. Encourage creativity and allow the team to come up with a unique feature to add to the program. It can be related to dates, time, or any other relevant topic.
